## Features

- **Dynamic Recipe Listings**: Display recipes from different chefs with real-time updates.
- **User Interaction**: Users can interact with recipes, save favorites, and provide feedback.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Hooks Usage**: Implemented React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side effects.
- **Prop Drilling**: Passed props through multiple layers to share data between components.
- **API Integration**: Retrieved recipe data from an external API.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used throughout the application.
- **CSS**: For styling components.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to APIs.
- **React Router**: For handling routing within the SPA.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NajibHossain49/CHEFS-TABLE-with-React.git
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CHEFS-TABLE-with-React
3. ***Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. ***Open your browser and go to
   ```
   http://localhost:3000.
   ```

  

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- **Browse through various recipes.**
- **Click on any recipe to view its details.**
- **Use the search feature to find specific recipes.**
- **Save your favorite recipes for easy access.**

## API Integration

CHEFS-TABLE uses external APIs to fetch recipes. Below is a brief overview of how the API integration works:

- **`useEffect`**: This hook is used to fetch data from the API when the component mounts.

    ```javascript
    useEffect(() => {
      const fetchData = async () => {
        const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/recipes');
        setRecipes(response.data);
      };
      fetchData();
    }, []);
    ```

- **`useState`**: Maintains the state of the recipe list.

    ```javascript
    const [recipes, setRecipes] = useState([]);
    ```

- **Prop Drilling**: Data is passed down from parent components to child components via props.

    ```javascript
    <RecipeList recipes={recipes} />
    ```

## Challenges

One of the significant challenges I faced while developing CHEFS-TABLE was creating the sidebar section, particularly when implementing multiple levels of prop drilling. 

### Struggles Include:

- **Complexity**: As the number of components increased, so did the complexity of managing state and passing props down multiple layers. This often led to confusion and made the code less maintainable.
  
- **Performance**: With deep prop drilling, any update in the parent component could trigger unnecessary re-renders in all child components, potentially impacting performance.
  
- **Code Readability**: The more props I had to drill down, the harder it became to read and understand the component structure, which affected the overall development experience.

### Solutions:

To mitigate these issues, I considered using **Context API** or **Redux** for state management. These tools can provide a more elegant solution for managing state across deeply nested components, reducing the need for extensive prop drilling.
